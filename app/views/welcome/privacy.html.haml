    %p Your privacy is important to us. Please read our policy below carefully.
    %h2 General information
    %p This policy sets out our privacy practices and explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit and use our sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content provided by Bourbon Inc., in existence now or in the future (“Bourbon Services”). This policy also details what settings we provide for you to control how your information is used on Bourbon, and how you can contact us with any questions or concerns.
    %h2 What we may collect
    %p In order to create an account with Bourbon, you are required to provide a valid email address at registration. Bourbon will not sell or disclose your name, email address or other personal information to third parties without your explicit consent, except as specified in this policy.
    %p When you log into Bourbon Services or load a web page from Bourbon Services, we collect and store your Internet Protocol address. We may use this information to fight spam, malware, and identity theft; to personalize Bourbon Services for you; or to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use Bourbon Services.
    %p When you create your Bourbon account, and authenticate via a third-party service like Facebook, we may collect, store, and periodically update the contact lists associated with that third-party account, so that we can make it easy for you to connect with your existing contacts from that service who are also on Bourbon. Connecting your Bourbon account to third-party applications or services is optional, and when you connect your account to an external app, you will be given the opportunity to grant permission. You can revoke your permission under your Bourbon account settings.
    %p We collect information about what Bourbon pages you access or visit, the software you use to access Bourbon (such as your operating system and browser), information about your mobile device (such as device model), information volunteered by you (such as through registration), the URLs of websites that referred you to us, and e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via email.
    %p Depending on which services you choose to use, Bourbon may require additional information, such as a shop name, billing information (including billing address, phone number, credit card information), a mobile telephone number, a physical mailing address, and/or payment information. As a shop owner if you choose to enable direct checkout, Bourbon may require information such as your social security number or tax ID, date of birth, bank account information and/or credit card information in order to verify your identity and provide this service to you.
    %p You may optionally choose to provide your full name and other personal information (such as birthday, gender, location) to be publicly displayed in connection to your account and activity.
    %p Your username, Bourbon ID or alias is publicly displayed and connected to your Bourbon activity. Other people may see your date joined, feedback, ratings, profile information, items listed for sale, shop pages, sold item listings, and comments in community spaces.
    %p For quality control and resolution seeking purposes, Bourbon maintains access to all communication between users through offers, orders, and private messaging.

    %h2 Email communications with us
    %p We may occasionally need to send you service-related messages.  Examples of service-related messages include a welcome email when you register your account, correspondence with Bourbon’s support team, important notifications about your account or changes to our services, as well as updates to our policies. These administrative messages are considered a basic part of Bourbon Services, and are not promotional in nature. You may not opt out from receiving service related messages from Bourbon. The default, required form of communication is email, though we may choose to offer additional ways to reach you, such as through text messaging (SMS) or physical mail.
    %p You can always opt out of non-administrative emails.
    %p Bourbon offers optional email newsletters. You must opt-in or subscribe to begin receiving newsletters, and subscription is available to both members and non-members. Members may subscribe or unsubscribe from optional newsletters under your account settings or by following the instructions contained in the newsletter emails.
    %p We will never email you to ask for your password or other account information. If you receive such an email, send it to us so we can take appropriate action.

    %h2 Disclosure of your information
    %p The information we collect is used to provide and improve Bourbon Services and content and prevent abuse. We don’t sell personal information about our users to any third party. Bourbon limits access to your personal information to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
    %p While Bourbon endeavors to provide the highest level of protection for your information, we may share your personal information with third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; or (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order.
    %p If we’re going to release your information, our policy is to provide you with advance notice unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order (e.g., under laws such as 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b), also known as gag orders). If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.
    %p We may disclose your information without providing you with prior notice if we believe it’s necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. In that case, we will endeavor to provide you with
    post-disclosure notice when permitted by law.
    %p We will independently object to requests for access to information about users of our site that we believe to be improper.
    %p When you a load a page on Bourbon that has a social plug-in from a third-party site or service, such as a Like or Send button, you are also loading content from that third-party site. That site may request cookies directly from your browser. These interactions are subject to the privacy policy of the third-party site.
    %p This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Bourbon does not own or control, or individuals that Bourbon does not employ or manage. If you provide your information to others on Bourbon or throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the information you provide to them. Bourbon does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. Bourbon is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other websites on the Internet, even those linked to or from the Bourbon site. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
    %p In some cases, Bourbon may choose to sell assets. In these types of transactions, member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If we’re acquired by or merged with another company and your information becomes subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you before the transfer. You can opt out of the new policy by deleting your account during the notice period.
    %h2 Public user content
    %p Content published and shared through Bourbon Services is publicly accessible, which means that everyone, including search engines, will be able to see it. By default, whatever you share through Bourbon Services will be made public. Although we do provide tools that let you write and edit drafts content prior to publication, you should assume that any content you provide us may become publicly accessible. This content may also be copied and shared by others throughout the Internet, including through features native to Bourbon Services, such as commenting and embedding.
    %p You are free to remove published content from your account, or even disable your account entirely. However, because of the fundamentally open nature of the Internet, the strong possibility that others will comment on or embed your content, and technological limitations inherent to Bourbon Services, copies of your content may exist elsewhere indefinitely, including in our systems.
    %h2 Cookies
    %p Bourbon uses a variety of technologies to help us better understand how people use our site and services and to estimate and report Bourbon's total audience size and traffic. For example, we use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use Bourbon Services. A cookie is a small piece of text, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website. We also use cookies to identify whether you have logged in and recognize that your web browser has accessed aspects of Bourbon Services, and we may associate that information with your account if you have one. This information, in turn, is sometimes used to personalize your experiences on Bourbon Services when you are logged in. We use it to keep track of preferences you specify; display the most appropriate content based on your interests and activity on Bourbon. To measure the deliverability of our emails to users, we may embed information in them, such as a web beacon or tag.
    %p Most browsers have an option for disabling cookies, but if you disable them you won’t be able to log into your Bourbon account, and won’t be able to use the vast majority of Bourbon Services.
    %p We respect Do Not Track (“DNT”) settings in browsers. If you are logged out of our services and have DNT enabled,we will not set cookies that can be used to aggregate information about your usage. We may use some cookies to enhance your experience by storing preferences or options. Again, you must have cookies enabled in order to log into our services.
    %p Some third-party services that we use may place their own cookies in your browser. These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer each time you visit Bourbon, but do not allow access to personally identifiable information from Bourbon. Note that this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and not the use of cookies by third parties.
    %h3 Data Storage & Retention
    %p Bourbon uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Amazon, to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run Bourbon. Although Bourbon owns its code, databases, and all rights to the Bourbon application, you retain all rights to your content.
    %p We maintain two types of logs: server logs and event logs.
    %h3 Server logs:
    %p Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page request made when you visit our sites. We have two types of server logs: nginx and application. These server logs may include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We will delete all server logs after 9 months or earlier.
    %h3 Event logs:
    %p Our event logs record user actions on the site, such as clicking through stories or scrolling. Event logs do not contain IP addresses, user names, user addresses, or user email addresses. They do contain user IDs generated by Bourbon, as well descriptions of action users take on the site. We may keep event logs indefinitely.

    %h2 Modifying your personal information or deleting your account
    %p If you are a registered Bourbon user, you can access or modify your personal information or delete your account by accessing your account settings.
    %p If you deactivate your account, you can reactivate it within 30 days by logging back in. After 30 days, your account and content will be deleted and unrecoverable.
    %p We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.
    This means that after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.
    %h2 Data security
    %p We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee the absolute security of this data. You use the service at your own risk, and you are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account. Your Bourbon account information is protected by a password. It is important that you protect against unauthorized access of your account and information by choosing your password carefully, and keeping your password and computer secure by signing out after using our services.
    %h2 Children
    %p Bourbon Services are intended for general audiences and are not directed to children under 13. We don’t knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us here. If we learn that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account.
    %h2 Changes to this Policy
    %p Bourbon may periodically update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Bourbon account or by placing a prominent notice on our site before the changes take effect.
    %p The most current version of the policy will always be here and we will archive former versions of the policy on our github page.
